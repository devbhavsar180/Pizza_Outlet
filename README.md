This Java-based project, titled "Pizza Outlet," is designed to simulate the operations of a pizza ordering system for a small to medium-sized pizza outlet. The system allows users to place orders for various types of pizzas, customize their orders with different toppings, and choose their preferred size and crust type. The project aims to streamline the ordering process, manage customer data, and provide an efficient way to track and fulfill orders. The system also includes features for managing inventory, processing payments, and generating order summaries.

## Data

The Pizza Outlet project handles various types of data to simulate a real-world pizza ordering system:

1. **Menu Data**: This includes details about the available pizzas, such as types, sizes, crust options, and prices. The menu data is typically stored in a structured format, such as an array or a database, and is accessed when customers place orders.

2. **Customer Data**: Information related to customers, including their names, contact details, and order history, is stored and managed by the system. This data is essential for processing orders, managing customer relationships, and personalizing the user experience.

3. **Order Data**: Each order placed by a customer is recorded in the system, including the selected pizzas, customization options, quantity, and total cost. The order data is used to manage the fulfillment process, track sales, and generate reports.

4. **Payment Data**: The system handles payment processing, capturing details of transactions such as payment method, transaction ID, and payment status. This data ensures that all financial transactions are recorded accurately and securely.

5. **Inventory Data**: To manage the ingredients and supplies needed for making pizzas, the system tracks inventory levels and updates them as orders are fulfilled. This data helps in maintaining adequate stock and reducing waste.

Each type of data is crucial for the smooth operation of the Pizza Outlet system, ensuring that the ordering process is efficient and that customers have a seamless experience.
